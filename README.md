This repo is for practicing HTML through The Odin Project

So far, I have practiced writing basic HTML boilerplate, adding character encoding, working with headers, lists, paragraphs, links, and images.

For this project, I will be writing a website showcasing some cooking recipes to demonstrate the knowledge I have thus far gained through The Odin Project.
