		<h2>Description</h2>
		<p>Fried rice is, while not very excitinig, a common and usually cheap food throughout China.</p>
		<p>This is a quick and simple, no non-sense dish. It's great for when you need something to eat, but nothing strikes your fancy, or you're out of
		ingredients, time, or energy to cook something else. That said, there are plenty of ways to add to this dish to make it both more nutritious and
		delicious, such as ham, tofu, corn, diced carrots, green peas, bok choy, and so on.</p>
